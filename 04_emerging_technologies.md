# Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR)

## Purpose
AR and VR technologies enable immersive, interactive learning by overlaying digital content onto the real world (AR) or fully immersing learners in virtual environments (VR). They improve engagement, retention, and allow safe exploration of complex concepts.
